# Design-of-Transonic-Axial-Fan
Design of Single Stage Transonic Axial Fan using CFD turbomachinery tool MULTALL.

1. Manual calculations along with appropriate assumptions carried out for the inlet parameters to design the single-stage axial transonic fan for given specifications.
2. Manual calculations done for estimating 1D flow velocity triangles and compared the results with the computations done using meangen.
3. Computational calculations done using stagen to obtain the design parameters along the radius and compared the results with the manual calculations performed using Free Vortex Law.
4. Output from the stagen given to Multall to perform the simulation for the stage until convergence is obtained for inflow and outflow mass rates.
5. The blade profiles obtained are visualized in 2D and 3D using CAD Software AUTODESK FUSION 360â„¢.
6. All the design criteria for the optimum fan performance are met.
7. Blade shapes obtained confirm the high chord, high twist nature of the fan blades.
